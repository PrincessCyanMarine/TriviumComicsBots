# TriviumComicsBots
This is the repository for the code of the bots from [Trivium comics' official discord server](https://discord.com/invite/sF6Hupjf8S)

**Rewrite not finished, expect bugs**

> I don't know why you would do that, but you are free to use this for your own bots if you want to. You can even modify it!
> 
> In that case, I just ask that you at least link to this repository and use the same license (what also means making it open source so be careful with tokens and stuff).
